steps to run the code:
Cs Elog: https://pcata007.cern.ch/elog/Cs137/
1.	Cesium data is available here: /afs/cern.ch/user/t/tilecali/w0/ntuples/cs
2.	First look at the Cs Elog .In the Cs Elog search for the run number you will use and look up all the information including the dead/off modules for that run.
(for example: January 11,2013
For EBA:  
10:37 Scan G2->G3 run 6339
11:22 Scan G3->G1 run 6341
12:13 Scan G1->G3 run 6344
13:03 Scan G3->G2 run 6346
13:47 Scan G2->G1 run 6348
14:32 Scan G1->G2 run 6351 

For EBC 
10:38 Scan G1->G2 run 6338
11:18 Scan G2->G3 run 6340
11:59 Scan G3->G2 run 6343
12:43 Scan G2->G1 run 6345
13:26 Scan G1->G3 run 6347
14:18 Scan G3->G1 run 6350

3.	For each side of extended barrel (EBA and EBC),  cesium source travel through TileCal in two direction(up and down). Therefore,
EBA (Direction1)
Run 1			6351			G1->G2 
Run2			6339			G2->G3
Run3			6341			G3->G1
Modules off: 40,58
EBA (Direction2)
Run 1			6348			G2->G1 
Run2			6346			G3->G2
Run3			6344			G1->G3
Modules off: 39,57
EBC (Direction1)
Run 1			6338			G1->G2 
Run2			6340			G2->G3
Run3			6350			G3->G1
Modules off: 40,58
EBC (Direction2)
Run 1			6345			G2->G1 
Run2			6345			G3->G2
Run3			6345			G1->G3
Modules off: 39,57
(there is no data for modules 40 and 58 for direction 1 and modules 39 and 57 for Direction 2 because we can not switch read-out while capsule moves behind LAr cryo support structures we are reading out only one module out of two while capsule moves through them. Therefore, we treat these modules off/dead for over code.


4.	Once we have data with full information, copy tha EBA data in Aside folder and EBC data in Cside folder.
5.	Run the code: ModuleLoop.C


root [0] .L ModuleLoop.C+
root [1] ModuleLoop()
Which SIDE would you like?
A
Which DIRECTION would you like?
1
Which 3 RUNS would you like?
6351
6339
6341
run1 = cs06351  run2 = cs06339  run3 = cs06341
Which MODULES are OFF? Type '0' to exit.
40
58
0

(repeat same procedure for EBC (both direction).
