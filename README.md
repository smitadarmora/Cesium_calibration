# Cesium_calibration
 
We studied a new procedure and developed a new and fast algorithm to improve
the calibration of the ATLAS ITC cells: D4, C10, E1 and E2. The cesium reconstruction method
used as default in the rest of the Hadronic calorimeter (integral method) does not give reliable and
robust estimations in these cells due to the many peculiarities described, while other more
sophisticated approach (like the amplitude method) were never tried.

The procedure and algorithm illustrated  use the cesium data for the
cell inter-calibration, while cosmic rays data were used for the initial setting of the scale
between the different type of cells. This new approach
helps to calibrate these special cells and reduce the non uniformity to a figure of the order
of one percent or smaller.
The time evolution of the ITC cells response extracted using this method shows a
similar behavior to the rest of the calorimeter cells in terms of down-drift and up-drift of
the response during periods of data taking and shutdown as well as a monotonic increase
in the dispersion of the cells response as a function of the time.
The calibration constants for these cells have been provided with our stand-alone
programs regularly along all the LHC Run-1 and integrated in the database together with
all the other detector constants. For Run-2, this approach is be fully integrated and implemented in the
standard cesium calibration system.
